## Why and why now? 
I'm working in Learning and Talent Development department in a large software company. During the last few months I'm participating in Data Science and Machine Learning nanodegree program via Udacity learning platform Which ignited my curiosity and pushed me to write this story.
Being part of an HR department, employee' attrition is a subject that is always under the spotlight. Especially, nowadays that recruiting talents becomes a real challenge. I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if we could anticipate the employee attrition in advance, or establish working processes that can reduce or even prevent attrition?
